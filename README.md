# link-ear

`link-ear` is a Rust/libp2p peer-to-peer chat and shared listening app. Peers can chat, co-manage a music queue, and keep playback state roughly synchronized through the Tauri desktop shell.

## Run

The primary client is the Tauri desktop app. Install frontend dependencies and build the web assets from the repository root:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run build
```

Run the desktop app in development with the Tauri CLI:

```powershell
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@^2 dev
```

The setup screen accepts display name, topic, listen multiaddrs, explicit peer multiaddrs, relay multiaddrs, and the mDNS toggle. Peers on the same LAN can use mDNS. Remote peers usually meet through a relay/rendezvous node.

Build the desktop bundle:

```powershell
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@^2 build
```

The relay address is also used as a rendezvous server. Each client registers under the current topic, periodically discovers other peers in that topic, dials their relayed addresses, and then tries to upgrade relay-only peers to direct P2P connections when possible.

Run a minimal public relay plus rendezvous node on a reachable host:

```powershell
cargo run --bin link-ear-relay -- --port 4001 --secret-key-seed 0
```

The relay also serves a small topology dashboard on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Use `--web-addr` to bind it somewhere else, for example on all interfaces:

```powershell
cargo run --bin link-ear-relay -- --port 4001 --web-addr 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Pass `--no-web` to disable the page. The dashboard shows the relay-observed control-plane topology: active relay connections, rendezvous registrations by namespace, advertised peer addresses, and recent relay/rendezvous events. Direct peer-to-peer edges are not visible to the relay unless clients explicitly report them later.

Open TCP and UDP on the chosen port. The relay prints its peer id at startup; clients use a full relay multiaddr:

```text
/ip4/203.0.113.20/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...
```

If the relay host needs to advertise a specific public address, pass it explicitly:

```powershell
cargo run --bin link-ear-relay -- --external-addr /ip4/203.0.113.20/tcp/4001
```

Client setup fields:

```text
Name                       Display name in chat
Topic                      Gossipsub topic, default link-ear.chat.v1
Listen                     Add listen multiaddrs
Peers                      Dial explicit peer multiaddrs
Relay                      Dial and reserve through relay multiaddrs
Disable mDNS               Disable LAN discovery
```

## Desktop frontend

The Tauri desktop UI is a React/Vite app under `desktop/`. Run the frontend preview from the repository root when iterating on UI only:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Build the assets Tauri serves from `desktop/dist`:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
```

Music commands:

```text
Append Bilibili BV + part       Add audio to the queue
Move queue item                 Opens a move vote
Remove queue item               Direct for own item, otherwise opens a vote
Play/Pause/Skip/Seek            Uses the current room voting rules
Vote Yes/No                     Respond to the active vote
```

`PART` is 1-based and defaults to `1`.

The desktop queue form only appends. Reordering is handled by move votes.

## Names

Clients announce their `peer_id`, display name, and join timestamp to the chat topic. Display names are only aliases: multiple peers may use the same visible name, and the peer id remains the unique identity. UIs may show a short peer id when a name needs disambiguation.

## History sync

Clients publish a lightweight history summary when a peer connects, when a peer subscribes to the chat topic, and then periodically afterwards. Connection/subscription events also schedule a short burst of follow-up summaries so peers do not have to wait for the periodic sync window. If a client sees another peer with more messages, it requests that peer's history. The peer replies with its retained chat records, and every client merges the response by message ID, keeping the newest `300` messages locally.

Message timestamps use microsecond precision for ordering. Duplicate history records are expected during sync and are silently ignored.

## Relay fallback

Relay-backed routes are kept during a short direct-connection handoff window. If
the direct route drops during that window, the relay route stays available for
chat, sync, playback, and vote messages. Once direct is settled and chat
subscription is ready, relay links may close for that peer.

## Music sync

Music sync uses a shared queue and playback state instead of P2P audio streaming. The peer that starts the next queue item resolves the Bilibili BV through the web API, announces a buffer prepare phase, and every expected peer streams the audio URL locally with HTTP Range requests before playback starts. Range fetch and decode run outside the main libp2p event loop, so skip/cancel/vote messages can still be processed while media is preparing. Stale stream events are ignored if the playback session, buffer operation, or track changed.

The resolver first prefers DASH audio and falls back to single-file `durl` media when needed. If WBI playurl returns HTTP 412, or a successful playurl response has no usable media URL, the backend tries the legacy playurl endpoint before reporting failure.

Queue enqueue is immediate and always appends. Moving tracks always opens a vote. Removing your own queued item is direct; removing another peer's queued item opens a vote. The current track requester can seek directly, while other seek requests open a vote. Pause, resume, and skip always open a vote. Majority thresholds count real room peers and exclude relay/rendezvous infrastructure peers. Each peer may cast one ballot per vote; votes close early once they pass or once pending peers can no longer make them pass.

## Manual smoke test

Use `docs/test-report-audit.md` to see how the real-world test report maps to current implementation and automated coverage. Use `docs/manual-smoke-test.md` for repeatable multi-peer testing. The smoke test covers a three-person room with one relay-only peer, one direct-capable peer, and one slower peer, including chat/history sync, queue votes, playback readiness, direct promotion failure, relay fallback, duplicate display names, IME input, peer overview, and status log checks.
